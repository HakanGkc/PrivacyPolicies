        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta">
            Last updated: <strong>2025-01-01</strong><br>
            Applies to the mobile application <strong>Çilek Akademi</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Teymek Elektronik Yazılım Mühendislik</strong>
            (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you or your child use
            the mobile application <strong>Çilek Akademi - Eğitici Oyunlar</strong> (the “App”).
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>1. Audience and children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is designed for children and families. We recognise the importance of protecting the
            privacy and safety of children online. We comply with applicable children’s privacy regulations,
            including the Google Play Families Policy and, where applicable, COPPA.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Parents and guardians</strong> should read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that
            they understand what data may be collected and how it is used.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1. Information you provide directly</h3>
        <p>
            The App does not require children to create an account or provide personal information such as
            name, address, or phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you contact us by email (for example, for support or feedback), we will receive the email
            address and any information you include in the message. This information is used only to respond
            to your request.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2. Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
            When you or your child use the App, certain information may be collected automatically by
            the platform and third-party services integrated into the App. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type, operating system version, and language settings</li>
            <li>Anonymous identifiers (for example, an advertising identifier or instance ID)</li>
            <li>App usage data such as screens visited, session duration, crashes, and performance data</li>
            <li>Approximate location (country or region) inferred from IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is collected solely to operate and improve the App, to show appropriate
            content and ads, and to ensure security and stability.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>3. Advertising and analytics</h2>
        <p>
            The App may display ads that are compliant with the Google Play Families Policy and are suitable
            for children and families. We do <strong>not</strong> allow interest-based or behavioural ads
            targeted to children based on their profile or activity over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Third-party advertising and analytics partners may collect and use limited data (such as
            device identifiers and usage data) to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver contextual ads (for example, based on the content of the App)</li>
            <li>Measure the performance and effectiveness of ads</li>
            <li>Understand how the App is used and improve its quality and stability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We instruct our partners to use such data only in compliance with children’s privacy requirements
            and to avoid creating profiles for behavioural advertising targeting children.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>4. In-app purchases</h2>
        <p>
            The App may offer in-app purchases (for example, removing ads or unlocking additional content).
            Payments are processed by the app store (Google Play) and we do not receive or store credit card
            numbers or other sensitive payment information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parents and guardians can control or restrict in-app purchases through their device or Google
            Play account settings.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>5. How we use information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the App</li>
            <li>To display child-appropriate and family-friendly ads</li>
            <li>To fix bugs, prevent fraud, and ensure security and integrity</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and app store policies</li>
            <li>To respond to support requests and communicate with parents or guardians</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>6. Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell personal information. We may share limited data with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Service providers and partners</strong> who help us provide the App, such as
                analytics, crash reporting, and advertising services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Authorities or regulators</strong> if required by law, court order, or to
                protect our rights, users’ safety, or comply with legal obligations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All such partners are required to handle data in accordance with applicable privacy laws
            and children’s privacy requirements.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
            We keep data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy,
            unless a longer retention period is required by law. When data is no longer needed, we will
            delete it or anonymise it in a secure manner.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>8. Children’s rights and parental controls</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>9. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Our servers and those of our service providers may be located in different countries. As a
            result, the information collected through the App may be transferred to and processed in
            countries outside your country of residence. We take appropriate measures to protect this
            data in accordance with applicable law.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-separator">

        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect information processed
            in connection with the App against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access. However, no
            method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
            security.
